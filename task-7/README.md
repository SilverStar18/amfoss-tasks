# **(Task - 7)** Ubiquitous UI


With the help of instructions given on the site, I was able to set-up flutter sdk. 
I used android studio for this task. The UI is being tested via an emulator.


Unfortunatelu, I found the resources misleading and spent a lot of time finding how to set dot indicator in stalteless widget. Though, now I am aware of the fact that the best way to solve this problem is using **PageView** and **Stack**. And then we can create the button*Create account* using **Floatingbutton**. I hope I will be able to submit it soon.
