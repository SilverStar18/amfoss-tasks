# **(Task - 4) Debugging Derbies**

There were aroubd 13 problems while debugging including syntax errors. Most of these were due to the '//' before the font import.
After these come the logical errors in the quiz. Some of these are:

 * Wrong position of start/stop button
 * Wrong formulas in operators and display codes
 * Time in millisecond should be divided by 1000 and not 100
 * Improper changes change in correctCount and wrongCount

I rewrote a few lines and now I think it works fine. 
Although, I am not sure about the unused imports(Coponent, ItemEvent, KeyAdapter). But since it doesn't mess with the output, I didn't remove them.
