# **(Task - 3)** Programming


***My HackerRank Username is*** **SilverStar1802**.


This was the task I would probably be most comfortable with, and yet I found it the most challenging, especially enhancing the speed of my program. I have yet to understand how time complexity works and what functions are faster than what functions (although *Stackoverflow* was the saving grace when it came to finding if len(str()) is faster or math.log10(), or if *if-else* is faster or *try-except* etc.)


Three of the tasks that I was unable to get **100/100** in are:
- Homework 
- Jack Jack code
- Pizza Fest

The problem with all the three was the same:- *Terminated due to timeout*
