# **INTROSPECTION**


## 1. Why must we choose you?

Because I am hardworkinf, comitted, ambitious and most importantly a quick learner, thanks to my curiosity and desire to learne. I want to keep working on this stuff and learn more about inner workings of the digital realm that is evolving quicker every minute. Although I had little to no knowledge about the tasks given to me, I tried my best to finish them. And finishing them was not my goal though, but the fact that I got to learn so much stuff I never knew before. I beleive that a club as active as yours require people who are like me; quick-witted as well as dedicated.


## 2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?

For the next month, I plan to complete the remaining tasks (as  dislike leaving stuff incomplete). After that, if selected, I plan to contribute to the current amfoss projects, learn new-skills and polish the ones I currently possess by working on small subtasks by contributing to the club. I also always wanted to try *hackathons* and *CTF*s. However if not, I would still polish my skills and try next year (S3), now that I have a general idea of how to complete the tasks. But the general goal is to keep a **gpa** of *8.5* or above.


## 3. How would you contribute back to the club? 

In the initial period, I would contribute to the currently active projects of the club by putting everything I know to use. And if that still is not enough I would be glad to learn all required skills as quickly as possible. Later I would like to work with fellow clubmates to build something really meaningful for the society and keep working on the Amfoss projects, as well as mentor the newer batches.


## 4. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

The resources for some askes were extremely staightforward (like *Star all amfoss repos, Spammmer Spaghetti*) while some were completely misleading (*like the flutter task, where resources were so misleading I spent days trying to figure how to use dots indicator with stateless widget*). I am aware that could be just me and that it was done on purpose to test the mettle of the candidates. Except this the selection process felt friendly to the first-timers yet challenging enough to the experienced coders. All the mentors and trainers were exyremely freindly a nd helpful.
